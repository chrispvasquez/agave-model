In 2017 we received funding through the CyberSEES program to create a cloud-ready model repository, capable of running any of the 212 models maintained by the CSDMS through a Gateway. The goal was to make it easier for researchers who are not skilled in computer science to run codes in a portable and reproducible manner.

Important for this effort was the ability to run jobs across multiple nodes through MPI in a portable way that enables researchers to run and share both simulations and visualizations of the results.

Key enabling technologies for our preliminary effort are Jupyter, Docker, Singularity, and the Agave Platform. To date, we have our first prototype of our cloud-ready system for the SWAN, a third-generation wave model that simulates short-crested and wind-generated waves in coastal regions.
